# TOPadminDashboard

The task is to create a copy of the given layout for an exemplar admin dashboard page (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png). This will be the first time that I am using CSS grid to design the layout for a page, and using grids nested within grids in order to create the desired layout on the page - up until now I have been using exclusively flex-box for designing my pages and having them be responsive.
